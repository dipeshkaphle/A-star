# Instructions for running code

- There are 3 C++ files that should be run for all the plots to be available.
  all_A_stars.cpp , profile_operations.cpp and profile_joins.cpp

## Compiling with g++/clang

> In windows, open powershell and navigate to the directory in which the code is
> located. In linux, open terminal and navigate to the directory in which the
> code is located.

- g++ -O3 -o all_A_stars all_A_stars.cpp to compile all_A_stars.cpp and
  ./all_A_stars to run it.
- g++ -O3 -o profile_operations profile_operations.cpp to compile
  profile_operations.cpp and ./profile_operations to run it.
- g++ -O3 -o profile_joins profile_joins.cpp to compile profile_joins.cpp
  and ./profile_joins to run it.
- g++ -O3 -o demo demo.cpp to compile demo.cpp and ./demo to run it.

## Using CMake and Make

- You must have Cmake and make installed for this.

  - cmake .
  - make all to build all the binaries
  - Run the binaries as you wish. The instruction for plotting will be printed
    at the end when you run the binaries.
